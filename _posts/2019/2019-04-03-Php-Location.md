## PHP Location Tracker

During the first semester in the second year of my degree (Computer Science) the coursework for Web Technologies was a PHP application, designed to track and store user's location for attendance.

With this background information, I designed and created Location Station!

This project introduced me to many technologies that I haven't used before such as PHP, CSS Grid, Ajax and MS SQL. I really enjoyed learning about each one of them, especially the CSS Grid but if I was to do this project again I would choose MySQL over MS SQL just for the better integration with PHP. CSS Grid was a pleasure to use and was made even easier with Google's developer tools which have a tool specifically for CSS Grid

The application functionality allowed staff to enter a student's location manually with a selection of rooms in the University, also the application had a search feature where a staff member(s) could see the last 24 hours of the student or of a location.
For the search I used Ajax (with jQuery) to create an auto-completion tool, this allowed the user to partially enter a location and then would filter the closest one that matched.

In conclusion, if I was to do this application again, I would use different technologies such as MySQL and use more JavaScript frameworks such as React.js. With that said I delivered the required functionality of the application, and letting it expose me to new technologies which were an interesting and engaging learning experience.
